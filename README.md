Thirst is a system that can monitor soil moisture and send notifications via
email in case the moisture is above or below a pre-configured threshold.

The main purpose of this system is to monitor plants and when they might need
water. Particularly useful for people who forget to water their plants. This
system will check the soil moisture once every day and notify the user if needed.
